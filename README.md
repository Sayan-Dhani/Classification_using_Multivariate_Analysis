Apply the Boosted Decision Tree & Artificial Neural network-based multi-variate analysis to classify the signal and background. 

- Utilized Boosted Decision Tree and Artificial Neural Network for training and testing and classify the simulated data of di-muon production from Z-particle with other simulated backgrounds of different or very similar topologies.
- Distinguished the signal from the background and ranked classification parameters for different backgrounds. We evaluated the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve and other efficiency curves.
- Improved performance by ~ 30% to the cut-based analysis of different background topologies using the same variables, ~ 2-3 % better despite similar signal and background topology.
